# STAR-JUMP


Star jump is an android game created by me for fun. I am a Computer science student from india. I created this android game while i was pursuing my second year of graduation. This project is all about android development. The user is provided with a star as a character in the GUI. User can move the star in either left or right direction. Star passes through a border both the sides by avoiding the obstacles coming in the way. And the there are coins in the way to collect. The maxium number of points collected by a user will be shown as a high-score.
